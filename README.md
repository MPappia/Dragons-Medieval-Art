# Dragons in medevial art - IIIF Project - M2 TNAH

My IIIF project is about the representation of dragons in medieval art, and more specifically in illuminations. To do this, I chose 7 images from different manuscripts. 
What these images have in common is the representation of dragons between the 13th and 15th centuries. They are different from the modern collective imagination, with large, winged creatures in dark colours. 

The use of IIIF standards can be used here to isolate the parts of the manuscripts that interest us, to understand the illuminations, and to annotate these parts to add a description or comment on the representation of these fantastic creatures. 

Finally, in this folder you will find a "manifest_v01.json" file, which is a first attempt at the manifest. In case the shared images don't work. 

Thanks for reading.
